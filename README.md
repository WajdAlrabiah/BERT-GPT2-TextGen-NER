# BERT-GPT2-TextGen-NER-Lab6

This project demonstrates **two main NLP tasks** using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library:
1. **Text Generation** using the GPT-2 model.
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using a fine-tuned BERT model.

Both tasks include **interactive input**, allowing users to enter custom text and view generated or recognized results.

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Generation:** Generates creative continuations from user input using GPT-2.  
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Extracts entities like names, organizations, locations, and dates using BERT.  
- **User Interaction:** Accepts input text directly from the user for both tasks.  
- **Confidence Display:** Shows the confidence score for each detected entity.
